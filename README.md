# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System â€“ Content-Based (MovieLens 20M)

This project builds a simple yet effective **content-based recommendation system** using the MovieLens 20M dataset. It recommends movies similar to a given title based on their genre composition using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **Source**: [MovieLens 20M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)
- Files used:
  - `movies.csv` â€“ Movie titles and genres
  - `ratings.csv` â€“ (Loaded but unused in content-based filtering)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Methodology

### âœ… Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed noisy characters from genres
- Reformatted genre strings for vectorization

### âœ… Step 2: TF-IDF Vectorization
- Converted movie genres into TF-IDF vectors using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Each movie represented as a numeric vector of genre weights

### âœ… Step 3: Cosine Similarity
- Calculated **cosine similarity** between every movie pair
- Stored in a similarity matrix for fast lookups

### âœ… Step 4: Recommendation Engine
- User inputs a movie title (e.g., `"Matrix, The (1999)"`)
- Model returns top N movies with the highest cosine similarity scores
- Flexible search helper to locate movie titles by fragment

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

```python
recommend_movies("Matrix, The (1999)")
